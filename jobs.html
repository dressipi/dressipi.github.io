<h2>Software Engineer</h2>
<div class='blurb'>
<h4>Software Engineer</h4>
<p>We’re seeking a mid to senior level engineer to join our smallish team building web applications that provide highly personalised product recommendations. You’ll be working on projects for some of the most successful high street retailers including Topshop, John Lewis, Marks & Spencer, the Shop Direct Group – including a ‘retail first’ project that is taking personalisation offline into stores.</p>
<h4>Where You Can Make An Impact</h4>
<p>You’ll chiefly be working on the apis and backend technology that support these customer facing applications. You’ll also be supporting the front end developers who consume these apis – experience with front-end technologies such as JavaScript/Backbone/React is a bonus. The majority of our work takes place on a set of rails apps (currently all on rails 4.2/rails 4.1 & ruby 2.2), with data stored in Elasticsearch, MySQL and MongoDB and hosted on AWS. A recent task you might have tackled was estimating a customer’s weight based on the other signup data they provide for a client that didn’t want to ask customers their weight.</p>

<h4>You Will Have</h4>
<ol>
<li>An interest in solving hard and diverse problems</li>
<li>The will and ability to pick up new technologies as required</li>

<p>You will be working hands-on with a rich variety of data, identifying metrics that are most relevant, presenting findings to stakeholders and helping the business make data-driven decisions. You will apply statistical, data-mining and/or machine learning techniques for a variety of modeling and relevance problems involving customers, their relationships and their fashion preferences.</p>
<p>Examples of the kind of tasks you will be tackling could be to cluster users based on their Fashion Fingerprint, find a way to identify which data points are more predictive than others, or to statistically analyse the purchasing and browsing behaviour of a demographic of users to gain valuable insights.
