<h2>Software Engineer</h2>
<div class='blurb'>
<h4>Software Engineer</h4>
<p>We’re seeking a mid to senior level engineer to join our smallish team building web applications that provide highly personalised product recommendations. You’ll be working on projects for some of the most successful high street retailers including Topshop, John Lewis, Marks & Spencer, the Shop Direct Group – including a ‘retail first’ project that is taking personalisation offline into stores.</p>
<h4>Where You Can Make An Impact</h4>
<p>You’ll chiefly be working on the apis and backend technology that support these customer facing applications. You’ll also be supporting the front end developers who consume these apis – experience with front-end technologies such as JavaScript/Backbone/React is a bonus. The majority of our work takes place on a set of rails apps (currently all on rails 4.2/rails 4.1 & ruby 2.2), with data stored in Elasticsearch, MySQL and MongoDB and hosted on AWS. A recent task you might have tackled was estimating a customer’s weight based on the other signup data they provide for a client that didn’t want to ask customers their weight.</p>

<ol>
<li>An interest in solving hard and diverse problems</li>
<li>The will and ability to pick up new technologies as required</li>
<li>Interest in building web applications capable of servicing millions of users</li>
<li>Good working knowledge of at least some of the technologies we use</li>
</ol>

<h4>What We Offer</h4>

<li>Building an exciting product that millions of people are using and appreciating everyday</li>
<li>Being part of one of the top technical teams in the UK</li>
<li>Relaxed, sociable work environment with freedom and independence</li>
