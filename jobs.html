<h2>Mid to Senior Level Engineer</h2>
<div class='blurb'>
<p>We're looking for a mid to senior level engineer to join our award-winning team near Oxford Circus in London. We're still a smallish team so you'll be working closely with the 6 other engineers, our styling team, designers and co-founders (including a Ruby Hero and BAFTA interactive winner).</p>
<p>We work with leading high street retailers including the Arcadia Group, Marks &amp; Spencer, Shop Direct group, amongst others, to provide highly personalised styling advice to their customers (embedded into the retailer's website). Some of the tasks we tackle include size prediction, clothing recommendations and automated outfit construction. While the output may be pretty and stylish the cold heart of technology beats within!</p>
<p>The majority of our work takes place on a set of rails apps (currently all on rails 4.1.6 &amp; ruby 2.1.2), with data stored in Elasticsearch, MySQL and MongoDB and hosted on AWS. We've also got our a homegrown recommendation engine, largely written in C++ (for speed).</p>
