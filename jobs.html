<p>Dressipi is an award-winning, mature start-up known for changing the way women buy clothes and make their dressing decisions. Since our launch in 2011, millions of women and many leading fashion retailers use our personalisation technology to find the right products that their customers will love.</p>
<p>We’re a small team making a big impact and are hugely passionate about leading the way in ‘true personalisation’. We are driven by putting the customer need at the heart of our solution and helping retailers genuinely embrace a one-on-one relationship with their shoppers.</p>

<p>In return, we offer an inspiring and collaborative environment and the opportunity to work alongside a world class team on one of the most ground-breaking personalisation solutions. We are tackling complex, data-related problems with some of the most diverse data sets, including contextual and emotional data as well as clothing feature analysis and user behaviour. We’re very lucky to have exceptional people and we place a high value on learning and personal growth.</p>
